# Board-Game-Info-Grabber
Another application created in order to get board game data from Board Game Geek. This time using PyQt.

 * .bat file to convert .ui file into .py file for ease of use in main.py
 * main.py is used to run application

 Based off Kivy created application. Will be using functions from that app as well as adding more features.
