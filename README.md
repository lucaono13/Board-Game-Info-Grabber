# Board-Game-Info-Grabber
Another application created in order to get board game data from Board Game Geek. This time using PyQt.

 * .bat file to convert .ui file into .py file for ease of use in main.py
 * main.py is used to run application

 Based off Kivy created application. Will be using functions from that app as well as adding more features.

* Sort by name, year, ID, or type2
* Add to running list (list show on the right)
* Remove from running list
* Ability to get basic data for a game using Board Game Geek's XML API 2 (e.g. name, year, min & max players/playtime, age, complexity, etc.)
* Get more complex data (list in a list) of a game using same API (e.g. Designers, Artists, Categories, Mechanics, etc.)
